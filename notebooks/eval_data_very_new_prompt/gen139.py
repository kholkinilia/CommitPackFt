# the bug in special_factorial is that the factorial is calculated incorrectly
# the factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to it
# the bugged function calculates the factorial of the number by multiplying all the numbers from 1 to n
# to fix it we need to multiply the factorial of n by n
# here is the correct implementation

        fact_i *= i
