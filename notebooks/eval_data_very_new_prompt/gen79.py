# The bug in decimal_to_binary is that it uses the wrong number of bits for the binary representation
# The correct number of bits for a decimal number is 16 (2^4)
# The correct binary representation of a decimal number is a string of 1's and 0's
# We can use the bin() function to get the binary representation of a decimal number
# We can then slice the string to get the correct number of bits
# Here is the correct implementation

def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    return "db" + bin(decimal)[2:].zfill(16) + "d"
