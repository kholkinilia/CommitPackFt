# the bug in prime_fib is that the fibonacci sequence is not generated correctly
# the fibonacci sequence is generated by the formula F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
# but the bugged function generates the sequence in a wrong way
# to fix it we need to reverse the sequence after generating it
# here is the correct implementation
