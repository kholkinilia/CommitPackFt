# The bug in the function is that it does not handle nested parentheses correctly.
# To fix this, we need to modify the code to check if a closing parenthesis is part of a nested group.
# If it is, we need to skip it and continue checking the rest of the string.
# We can do this by adding an if statement inside the for loop that checks if the current character is a closing parenthesis and if it is part of a nested group.
# If it is not part of a nested group, we add it to the current_string and continue checking the rest of the string.
# If it is part of a nested group, we skip it and continue checking the rest of the string.

# Here is the modified code:
