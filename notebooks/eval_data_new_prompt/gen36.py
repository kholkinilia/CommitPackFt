# The bug in fizz_buzz is that it does not correctly handle numbers that are multiples of both 11 and 13.
# To fix this, we need to add an additional condition to the if statement that checks if the current number is a multiple of both 11 and 13.
# We can do this by adding an else statement that appends the current number to the list if it is not a multiple of either 11 or 13.
