    This function calculates the sum of squares of elements in a list.
    It handles the edge cases where the list is empty or contains only one element.
    It also handles the edge cases where the list contains only even numbers.
    The function uses a list comprehension to generate a new list that contains the squares of the elements in the original list.
    The function then returns the sum of the elements in the new list.
